### Overview

By default, when a ScalaCheck property fails, you'll see its inputs
(e.g. `ARG_0: ...`) but not the expression that actually failed. In
many cases it is useful to be able to see the test or comparison that
failed.

This library provides a `Claim(...)` macro which wraps any `Boolean`
expression and converts it into a labeled `Prop` value. If the
property fails, ScalaCheck will show you this label.

### Quick Start

Claimant supports Scala 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13.0-RC1 -- it is available
from Sonatype.

To include Claimant in your projects, you can use the following
`build.sbt` snippet:

`libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "claimant" %` ![tag-badge][]

Claimant also supports Scala.js. To use Claimant in your Scala.js
projects, include the following `build.sbt` snippet:

`libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %%% "claimant" %` ![tag-badge][]

**Please note** that Claimant is still a very young project. While we
will try to keep basic source compatibility around the `Claim(...)`
macro itself, it's very likely that Claim's library internals will
change significantly between releases. No compatibility (binary or
otherwise) is guaranteed at this point.

### Examples

Here's an example of using `Claim(...)` to try to prove that `Float`
is associative:

```scala
package mytest

import org.scalacheck.{Prop, Properties}
import org.typelevel.claimant.Claim

object MyTest extends Properties("MyTest") {
  property("float is associative") =
    Prop.forAll { (x: Float, y: Float, z: Float) =>
      Claim((x + (y + z)) == ((x + y) + z))
    }
}
```

Unfortunately for us, this isn't true and ScalaCheck will quickly find
a counter-example:

```
[info] ! MyTest.float is associative: Falsified after 22 passed tests.
[info] > Labels of failing property:
[info] falsified: 0.2962196 == 0.29621956
[info] > ARG_0: 0.29622045
[info] > ARG_1: -8.811786E-7
[info] > ARG_2: 1.0369974E-8
```

The `Claim(...)` call inspects the expression and tries to determine
what kind of operator is being used. Finding `==`, it captures the
left- and right-hand sides of that operator. Since the values are not
equal, it labels the property with:

> falsified: 0.2962196 == 0.29621956

This means that in addition to seeing which inputs cause a failure, we
also see how much we failed by (around `4e-8` in this case).

Similarly, in some cases we want to be sure that at least one of
several conditions is true. In this case, we want to be sure that
either `n` is zero, or that `n` is not equal to `-n`.

```scala
package mytest

import org.scalacheck.{Prop, Properties}
import org.typelevel.claimant.Claim

object AnotherTest extends Properties("AnotherTest") {
  property("ints have distinct inverses") = {
    Prop.forAll { (n: Int) =>
      Claim(n == 0 || n != -n)
    }
  }
}
```

Once again, we are out of luck! It turns out that `Int.MinValue` is
its own negation (there is no positive value large enough to represent
its actual negation). ScalaCheck helpfully shows us this:

```
[info] ! AnotherTest.ints have distinct inverses: Falsified after 0 passed tests.
[info] > Labels of failing property:
[info] falsified: (-2147483648 == 0 {false}) || (-2147483648 != -2147483648 {false})
[info] > ARG_0: -2147483648
```

In this case, `Claim(_)` helpfully shows us the how the different
branches evaluate (summarizing each branch with `{true}` or
`{false}`). Being able to see that the right branch ended up testing
`-2147483648 != -2147483648` cuts to the heart of the problem, and
doesn't leave the caller guessing about how the conditions were
evaluated.

### Details

The `Claim(_)` macro recognizes many different kinds of `Boolean`
expressions:

 * `==` and `!=` (universal equality)
 * `eq` and `ne` (referential equality)
 * `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` (comparisons)
 * `&&`, `&`, `||`, `|`, `^`, and `!` (boolean operators)
 * `isEmpty` and `nonEmpty`
 * `startsWith` and `endsWith`
 * `contains`, `containsSlice`, and `apply`
 * `isDefinedAt`, `sameElements`, and `subsetOf`
 * `exists` and `forall` (although `Function1` values can't be displayed)
 * `Equiv#equiv`

The `Claim(_)` macro also recognizes certain kinds of expressions
which it will attempt to annotate, such as:

 * `size` and `length`
 * `compare`, `compareTo`, and `lengthCompare`
 * `min` and `max`
 * `Ordering#compare` and `PartialOrdering#tryCompare`
 * `Ordering.Implicits.infixOrderingOps`

(For examples of the labels produced by these, see `ClaimTest`.)

It should be fairly straightforward to extend this to support other
shapes, both for `Boolean` expressions and for general annotations.

### Representation and formatting

Claimant uses its own `Render[A]` typeclass to produce human-readable
representations of values. We get a number of benefits from this:

  1. We can provide a more useful representation of arrays than you
     would get with `.toString`.
  2. We can quote and escape `String` and `Char` values to make it
     easier to see their exact value.
  3. We support user-provided display strategies for types they don't
     control.
  4. We support all of the above recursively, allowing collections,
     tuples, case classes, etc. to take advantage of all of these
     together.

For types that don't have their own `Render` instances, Claimant will
use a low-priority implicit value to provide an implementation based
on `.toString`. Some attempt has been made to provide implementations
for most built-in Scala types, but PRs adding support for new
instances (along with tests exercising them) will be gladly accepted.

In particular, Claimant makes it easy to define `Render`
implementations for case classes. Simply do the following:

```scala
case class MyClass(...)

object MyClass {
  implicit val renderForMyClass: Render[MyClass] =
    Render.caseClass[MyClass]
}
```

The code above will define a render instance for `MyClass` which will
render each of its fields with its corresponding instances. (In the
future Claimant may use Shapeless to derive `Render` instances
automatically.)

### Purity

Currently `Claim(...)` will potentially evaluate its expression (or
sub-expressions) multiple times, in any order. In the future we could
be more uptight about preserving execution order and ensuring
sub-expressions are run exactly as they would be, but so far this
hasn't been a priority.

For example, assuming that the `missilesFiredAt` method is
side-effecting, and returns the number of missiles that were just
fired, consider the following code:

```scala
def missilesFiredAt(target: String): Int = {
  val num = scala.util.Random.nextInt(3) + 3
  println(s"firing $num missiles at $target")
  num
}

property("notTooManyMissiles") =
  Claim((missilesFiredAt("moon") max missilesFiredAt("mars")) < 4)
```

Setting aside the questionable wisdom of launching missiles during a
test, here's an example of the output we might see:

```
firing 5 missiles at moon
firing 3 missiles at mars
firing 4 missiles at moon
firing 4 missiles at mars
firing 4 missiles at moon
firing 3 missiles at mars
[info] ! MissileTest.notTooManyMissiles: Falsified after 0 passed tests.
[info] > Labels of failing property:
[info] falsified: 4 max 4 {4} < 4
```

As we can see, Claimant is evaluating each expression multiple times.
The values we see in the test label (`4` for the Moon and `4` for
Mars) aren't necessarily the same ones used to describe the test
failing, we also see that at various points we launched `5` missiles
at the Moon, and `3` missiles at Mars.

In cases where side-effects are unavoidable, consider evaluating them
*before* calling `Claim(...)`:

```
property("notTooManyMissiles") = {
  val x = missilesFiredAt("moon")
  val y = missilesFiredAt("mars")
  Claim((x max y) < 4)
}
```

This will result in more consistent test output:

```
firing 5 missiles at moon
firing 5 missiles at mars
[info] ! MissileTest.notTooManyMissiles: Falsified after 0 passed tests.
[info] > Labels of failing property:
[info] falsified: 5 max 5 {5} < 4
```

### Limitations

Currently `Claim(...)` only expands a set of known methods. This means
that if you have methods which return `Boolean` and write something
like `Claim(Verifier.verify(dataSet))` your test failures will look
something like this:

```
[info] ! FancyTest.verify data sets: Falsified after 4 passed tests.
[info] > Labels of failing property:
[info] falsified: false
[info] > ARG_0: DataSet(...)
```

The ways to fix this are:

 1. Have `verify` return a richer result.
 2. Inline the `verify` logic in the `Claim(...)` call.
 3. Extend *Claimant* to support `Verifier.verify`.

Another problem is that `Claim(...)` inspects method calls based on
their AST shape. This means that type application, implicit
parameters, etc. need to be explicitly supported. This also means that
implicit enrichment (or *bedazzlement*) can muddy the waters a bit and
obscure the underlying values.

(For an example of how to deal with enrichment, see the support for
`Ordering.Implicits.infixOrderingOps`.)

### Development

To measure code coverage for 2.12, do the following:

```
$ sbt '++ 2.12.6' coreJVM/clean coverage coreJVM/test coverageReport
```

Assuming everything works, the result should end up someplace like:

```
.jvm/target/scala-2.12/scoverage-report/index.html
```

To measure coverage in 2.11 you'd instead do:

```
$ sbt '++ 2.11.12' coreJVM/clean coverage coreJVM/test coverageReport
```

And the result would end up someplace like:

```
.jvm/target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report/index.html
```

There's at least some code in Claimant that is specific to either 2.11
or 2.12, making it unlikely that we'll achieve 100% coverage under
either version independently.

### Future Work

There are a ton of possible improvements:

 * Support more methods/shapes.
 * Minimize recomputation in the macro.
 * Consider using raw trees instead of quasi-quotes.
 * Consider supporting fancy diagrams
 * Consider supporting color output
 * Consider an extensible/modular design
